This is a repository created for the subject Knowledge and data representation for the Master in Computational Biology of the Polytechnic University of Madrid.
This course focuses on the use of artificial intelligence systems to make automatic inferences that process or estract knowledge from databases usinf machine learning techniques. The course combines theory and practice with a challenge based learning project where, in groups of two, we had to solve a challenge. My group decided to work on the mushroom classification problem from the Kaggle's mushroom database (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). 

The goal of our project to understand the problem -how to differenciate edible and poisonous mushrooms- and to find a solution to the challenge. To do so, we created the following Google Sites portfolio: https://sites.google.com/view/mushroomclassification/mushrooms. In the e-portfolio you can find the following:
1) Mushrooms
2) Big Ideas
3) Challenge Proposal
4) Timeline
5) Questions
6) Research
7) Solution Proposals
8) Final Presentation
9) Journals

As a part of this project, I also performed some statistical analyses for the mushroom dataset using python, which we can also find in this repository.
