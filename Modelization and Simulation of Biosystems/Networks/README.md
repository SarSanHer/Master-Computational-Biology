# Extended Biological Processes: Networks

These codes carry out a numerical simulation of a rumor propagation process that start with a single individual carrying a hot new. The simulation follows the numbers of informed individuals at each (time discrete) generation in different network models (Erdös-Rényi, Small-world and Preferential-Attachment models).  
For further explanation of the code and its results, refer to the attached PDF in this directory.
